Dropkick is a tetris clone written in C++ using SDL. I went through a tetris phase after watching the AGDQ exhibition of Tetris The Grand Master https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwDUiCzPVU

It was meant to be a recreation of several variants but I think I only got the NES rules implemented. I'll probably come back to this at some point to at least add a menu for picking modes instead of doing it in code, and maybe some sounds. But here it sits for now.

The code architecture was based on a book by Mike McShaffry called Game Coding Complete, which in retrospect was way too much architecture for this small project. Live and learn right.
